# Prompts:

1. Provide a code that shows all use cases of async await and exceptions it might face. The code should use game terms. -> Provides code with delays for async await and uses example of loading game resources.
2. Add an event in the code that triggers the exception in LoadResourcesAsync() in the code above -> Adds a variable to add event and sets the invoke within catch block.
3. What are the cons of using an async await in your code? How to improve or avoid such scenarios? -> Provides the potential pitfalls of asynchronous operations i.e Increased complexity, Performance overhead, Improper usage, Error handling and then provides solutions i.e Understanding the Async/Await model, How to avoid blocking, ConfigureAwait, Error handling and why using Async all the way is important.
