// While async and await are powerful features in C# for handling asynchronous operations, they do come with some potential pitfalls:

// Increased Complexity: Asynchronous code can be more difficult to understand and debug compared to synchronous code. This is especially true when dealing with exception handling and control flow.
// Performance Overhead: There is a small amount of overhead associated with async/await due to the state machine that is created to handle the asynchronous operation. This is usually negligible, but for very performance-critical code, it might be a consideration.
// Improper Usage: Using async and await improperly can lead to issues such as deadlocks, thread pool exhaustion, and performance degradation. For example, using Task.Result or Task.Wait on an async task can lead to deadlocks.
// Error Handling: Exceptions thrown in an async method can’t be caught with a traditional try/catch block unless the method is awaited.
// To improve or avoid these scenarios, consider the following:

// Understand the Async/Await Model: Make sure you understand how async/await works in C# before using it. This includes understanding how the Task Parallel Library (TPL) works, how continuations are scheduled, and how exceptions are propagated.
// Avoid Blocking: Avoid mixing blocking and async code. Using blocking calls can lead to deadlocks and other issues. Instead of using Task.Wait or Task.Result, always use await.
// Use ConfigureAwait: If you’re writing library code, use ConfigureAwait(false) to avoid capturing the synchronization context. This can help avoid deadlocks.
// Error Handling: Always handle exceptions in async methods. Unhandled exceptions in async methods can bring down your entire application.
// Async All the Way: When you start using async/await, you should use it all the way through your code. Converting part of your code to async while the rest remains synchronous can lead to issues.
